## What
`kanmer check-pr` phase 1: a merge-gate CLI plus a GitHub Actions job (`kanmer-gate`) that fails a PR when it has no board ticket or the ticket has open questions.

## Why
GitHub is the merge boundary, and today nothing ties a PR to its board record — Pegasus shipped seven ticketless PRs after its board froze. Phase 1 lands the two checks that need no new record formats: `NO_TICKET` and `OPEN_QUESTIONS`.

## Approach
- `evaluateMergeGate` in `packages/core/src/merge-gate.ts`; CLI at `packages/mcp-server/src/check-pr.mjs`. JSON verdict on stdout, `::error::` workflow commands on stderr.
- Read-only `KanmerStore` over a fetched `kanmer-board` worktree — never call `init()`/`ensureInit()` (it would write a board skeleton into the CI worktree); `--board` must never point at the PR tree.
- Ticket resolution: PR-body footer `Kanmer: <ID>`, else branch prefix `/^([A-Z0-9]{2,6}-\d+)/i` (area prefixes are alphanumeric), else fail `NO_TICKET`.
- Open questions counted with core’s `countCheckboxes(…, { stopAtParked: true })` — parked questions pass; one checkbox parser, no second regex.
- Board fetch failure fails closed: exit 2 (check could not run) is distinct from exit 1 (check failed).
- GHA job `kanmer-gate` added to the PR workflow ([[CORE-032]]).

## Verification
- [ ] PR with no ticket reference fails `NO_TICKET`; footer and branch-prefix resolution both pass
- [ ] Ticket with open unparked questions fails `OPEN_QUESTIONS`; parked-only questions pass
- [ ] Board fetch failure exits 2 and the job fails
- [ ] `kanmer-gate` green on a compliant PR

## Outcome

PR #155 (https://github.com/collisionengineers/kanmer/pull/155) merged to origin/main as 0c5ed84ed0128aed6c8a60bec265a8dcb589061a. The phase-1 read-only merge gate is live in the production chain `kanmer-gate → check-pr.mjs → evaluateMergeGate → KanmerStore`. Merged-main proof is recorded in `proof/proof.md`; hosted verify passed after MCP-043 repaired the generated plugin artifact. Local stale-resolution and generated-byte parity failures, plus live GitHub/protection evidence, remain explicitly preserved as environment-sensitive or INCONCLUSIVE boundaries.
